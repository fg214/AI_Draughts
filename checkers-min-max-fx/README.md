# JavaFX Checkers Application
To run this code you must use an IDE as it is not yet possible to compile a JavaFX 14 application with Java 11.
As the JavaFX modules are imported via maven, an IDE which supports maven POM files are also require. (Any modern IDE such as Netbeans, Intellij and Eclipse will support this)
